# DDoS_Attack_Detection_And_Classification
DDoS attacks or Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack targets websites and servers
by disrupting network services. A DDoS attack attempts to exhaust an application's
resources. The perpetrators behind these attacks flood a site with errant traffic, resulting in
poor website functionality or knocking it offline altogether. DDoS attacks are wide-reaching,
targeting all sorts of industries and companies of all sizes worldwide. With that stated, certain
industries, such as gaming, ecommerce, and telecommunications, are targeted more than
others. DDoS attacks are some of the most common cyberthreats, and they can potentially
compromise our business, online security, sales, and reputation. Here we are using a machine
learning approach for DDoS attack types classification and prediction. DDoS detection is
the process of distinguishing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks from normal
network traffic in order to perform effective attack mitigation. This can be done by
comparing the speed and accuracy of the site or servers. By applying the machine learning
models we can generate a confusion matrix for identification of the model performance. Here
we implement prediction and classification of DDoS attacks using RNN and Decision Tree
algorithm.
